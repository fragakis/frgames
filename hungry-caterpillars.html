    <h1>🐛 Hungry Caterpillars — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>FR Games ("we", "us", "our") built <strong>Hungry Caterpillars</strong> as a freemium mobile game. This Privacy
        Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong> The game does not require an
        account, login, or registration of any kind.</p>
    <p>All game data — including your player name, scores, progress, gems, stars, badges, and preferences — is stored
        <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using your browser's local storage. We have no access to this data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services, which may collect information as described in their own privacy
        policies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — We display ads to support the free version of the game. AdMob may collect
            device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to serve relevant ads. See <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases. RevenueCat processes transaction
            data through the respective app stores (Google Play / Apple App Store). See <a
                href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat's Privacy
                Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Store / Apple App Store</strong> — When you make a purchase, the transaction is
            processed entirely by the respective store. We do not receive or store any payment details (credit card
            numbers, billing addresses, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
    <p>The free version of the game displays interstitial and rewarded video ads powered by Google AdMob. AdMob may use
        advertising identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID or Apple's IDFA) to serve personalized ads.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking → disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track"
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Premium users who purchase the Premium upgrade will not see any ads.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The game offers a one-time premium upgrade ("Hungry Caterpillars Pro") that unlocks additional features and
        removes ads. This purchase is processed through Google Play or the Apple App Store. We do not collect or have
        access to any financial or payment information.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Hungry Caterpillars is a family-friendly game suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since we do not
        collect any personal information at all, no special handling is required.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All game data is stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time by clearing the app's data
        through your device settings or by uninstalling the game. We do not retain any data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Last updated" date
        at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
